CURRENT FEATURES

- Two buttons (Background: randomly changes the UI background color) and (Text: randomly changes the texts colors uniformly)

Some Ideas To Improve are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Add some an Image view and some cool features
- Regulate the progress bar to match with the sounds when the text button is pressed. 
- Figure a way to change text color: Done

# APP IDEA

==>  This app is Backstage (the ap for upcoming models and actors), some fefatures to implement would be added a video/audio sharing fetaure where users can post their work anytime and go viral. (The reason why upcoming actors/models run to Tiktok, instead of Backstage. Because, backstage is too expensive for beginers). Thoughts? ðŸ¤”
